# web-scraping-challenge
Week 12 Homework

This project scrapes data about Mars from various web sites and stores it in an html page.

mission_to_mars.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file I used to scrape data from the websites.

scrape_mars.py contains the functions I used to scrape the data and make it useable by app.py.

app.py is the app itself, which combines the data with the index.html file in the templates folder to put the scraped data on the web.
